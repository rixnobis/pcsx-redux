Emulator side of the guest command port (0x1f8020a4). See
src/mips/common/hardware/pcsxcmd.h for the protocol and the reasoning.

The guest hands over a pointer to a command struct with a plain volatile store.
Everything the emulator says back is written into that struct: there is no
return channel, and there deliberately isn't one, because the absence of a
write is what tells a guest running on an older build that nothing heard it.

// pauses; a malformed command is reported by writing a status into the struct
// when the struct itself is readable, and ignored when it is not.
